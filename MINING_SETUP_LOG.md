# Bettensor Mining Setup Log

## ✅ Project Forked
- Forked from: https://github.com/opentensor/bettensor-miner
- My fork: https://github.com/Jtreminio98/bettensor-miner

## ✅ Local Setup Progress
- Cloned the repo to local machine using Git Bash
- Navigated into project folder
- Installed Python 3.10 (64-bit)
- Used pip to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

## ⚠️ Issue Encountered
- `nvidia-nccl-cu12` package could not be installed via pip due to PyPI redirect issues
- Attempted fix using `nvidia-pyindex` as instructed by the package metadata
- Still unable to install `nvidia-nccl-cu12`

## 🔍 GPU Compatibility Check
- Device: Intel(R) HD Graphics 520 (integrated graphics)
- ❌ No dedicated NVIDIA GPU present
- ✅ Confirmed via: `wmic path win32_VideoController get name`

## 🔧 Next Steps
- Proceeding with **code exploration and simulation only**
- Will not run actual mining due to lack of compatible GPU
- Planning to understand neuron structure and miner entry points
- Will test miner execution without remote calls (no blockchain participation)
